# Creating a Lab

## Markdown

The body of the lab content is written in markdown.
Shipkin uses the [Commonmark](http://commonmark.org/) flavor of
Markdown, with a few [extensions](../extensions/index.html) (the [Commonmark Java](https://github.com/atlassian/commonmark-java) implementation, to be precise).

## Top matter

The top matter is an optional block at the beginning of a markdown file.
It is delimited by three `-`.
You can set a `pageTitle`, specify `discussionPoints`, `wrapUp` and
`instructorNotes` as well as custom variables like `favoriteAnimal`.
Expand `index.md` below to see details.

{{codebase-file codebase="shipkin-course" path="units/using-shipkin/labs/index.md" lang="md" ref="master" hidden="true"}}

The `pageTitle` will be rendered as the subtitle of the page on the
current page header banner and appended to the html-title of the page.

The `discussionPoints` can be referenced like this
`::discussionPoints::` anywhere in the markdown.

::discussionPoints::

Discussion Points are viewable as a slide while in [instructor mode](#instructor-mode).

The `wrapUp` can be referenced like this `::wrapUp::` anywhere in the
markdown.

::wrapUp::

Wrap up is viewable as a slide while in [instructor mode](#instructor-mode).
If no wrap up is available, the wrap up slide will show the discussion
points.

The `instructorNotes` can consist of arbitrary markdown to be used by
instructors during delivery.

Other variables in the top matter can be referenced within the markdown.
For example, the `favoriteAnimal` can be referenced like this
`Animal: ::favoriteAnimal::` anywhere in the markdown and will be
rendered as: Animal: ::favoriteAnimal::.

## Instructor mode
Click on the course version at the bottom of the page
