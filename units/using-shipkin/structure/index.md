# Purpose

We use the below course structure to ensure consistency between courses
and to maximize course maintainability.

# Hierarchy

We arrange the course into a hierarchy of *units* and *subjects*, each
labeled with a title.
Units and subjects should divide content by topic.
Titles should be used to describe the content of a given unit or
subject.
Do not use units and subjects to divide the course content by unit of
time (days or weeks, for example).

Each subject contains a series of *lessons*, which contain a
*description* and one or more *materials*.
Descriptions should be a **short** phrase describing the lesson.

Each material has a title, which can be *lab*, *slides*, or an arbitrary
value.
The *lab* and *slides* types should be favored over arbitrary types.
Each lesson should have at most one material of each type.

Materials with type *slides* should use Google Presentations rather than
referencing local files.

## Top-level

The top-level directory of the course repository should contain:

-   A `courses` directory, which contains one or more courses, in this
    case it is `shipkin`.
-   A `units` directory, which contains all the units, which can be
    shared between courses.        
-   A `gradle` directory along with two wrapper scripts: `gradlew` and
    `gradlew.bat`.

### Configuration

The top level `build.gradle` file contains, in particular, the version
of the courses in the `topLevelCourseVersion` variable.
The version should follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for
the course material.

{{codebase-file codebase="shipkin-course" path="build.gradle" lang="groovy" ref="master" hidden="true"}}

Do not tie the course version to the version of any software included in
the course, as the material and the software tend to change
independently.

A `settings.gradle` which contains the project name and includes the
contained courses.
{{codebase-file codebase="shipkin-course" path="settings.gradle" lang="groovy" ref="master" hidden="true"}}

## Courses

Courses are stored under their name in the `courses` directory. 
In our case as `shipkin`.
There can be multiple courses per repo.

Within the course folder there are multiple files required.
-   A `pal.example.properties` file.
    This file contains examples of the credentials needed to deploy the
    course.
    This file is meant to be copied to a `pal.properties` file which is
    **not** checked into version control.
    The credentials file does not vary per course.
-   A `course.example.properties` file.
    This file contains examples of the credentials needed to secure the
    course.
    This file is meant to be copied to a `course.properties` file which
    is **not** checked in.
    The credentials vary from course to course.
 
-   The `build.gradle` file contains all configuration for the course. 
    -   `courseTitle`, `courseVersion` and `baseName` are required.
    -   `units` is an array that specifies the order in which units are
        rendered on the index page.
    -   `useSecurity` is a boolean field that toggles the use of basic
        auth when the course is deployed.
        If no value is provided it defaults to true.
    -   `feedbackUrl` is a link to your Google form for accepting
        feedback.
        See the [feedback section](../feedback/index.html) for more info.
    -   `feedbackUrlField` is the `name` attribute of the input
        containing the *url* field on your feedback form.
        It should look something like `entry.8888888888`.
    -   `disclaimer` can be set to `true` in the `shipkin` closure
        (it is `false` by default).
    -   `reviewSpace` is the space used to deploy the application for
        review on CF.
    -   `productionSpace` is the space used to deploy the application
        for production on CF.
    -   `contextCode` (optional) to turn on specific partials, look at
        the [partial file extension](../extensions/index.html#partial-file)
        for more details.
    -   `topicKey` defines topics and the color used for them.
        Topics can be set for lessons in the _unit.json_.
        The following colors are available.
        -   light-blue
        -   teal
        -   red
        -   orange
        -   green

    {{codebase-file codebase="shipkin-course" path="courses/shipkin/build.gradle" lang="groovy" ref="master" hidden="true"}}

The `site` directory within the `courses/shipkin` directory holds the
content for the `shipkin` course.

## Units

The order of the units is defined in each course's `build.gradle` file.

Directories within a unit, i.e. _best-practices_,
_lab-acceptance_, _slides_ and _style_ correspond to a lesson.

We do not add numbering to the directories since this makes them harder
to reorder.
The order of the subjects and lessons is defined in each unit's
`unit.json` file.

More details on units can be found [here](../shipkin-units/index.html).

### Lessons

The material for each lesson is nested under the lesson's folder.
We name the markdown file `index.md`.
All other resources in the folder are given names that describe their
content.
Do not add numbering to these resources since it makes it harder to
reorder them within a document.
